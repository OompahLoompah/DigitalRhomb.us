            <p>Hi! Thanks for checking out my site! My name is Sean Heuer and I'm a through and through geek. I've done work as a Systems Administrator, Programmer, Freelancer, and Groundskeeper so pretty much anything you need I can do! I graduated from the University of Oregon in December 2013 with a B.Sc in Computer and Information Science. From that experience I found that the one thing I love above all else is learning new things so I'm always jumping from project to project. I've written projects from websites to artificial intelligence and always love finding out something new!</p>
